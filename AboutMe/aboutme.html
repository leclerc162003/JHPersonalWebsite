        <h3>I am graduate from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, School of InfoComm Technology, Diploma in Information Technology.
            Throughout my span in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I picked up skills from Mobile Development in Android and iOS to 
            working with the Amazon Web Services softwares. I also had an One-Year Internship with OCBC where I was part of the 
            Mobile Development Team, working on the OCBC Business Mobile Banking and OCBC Digital. </h3>
    
        <h3>
            I am also passionate about Investing, joining the CIMB Investing Challenge in 2022/2023, finishing 4th runner up in the 
            competition. I am actively researching on different companies around the world, finding their value and determine
            if they are worth investing in. 
        </h3>

        <h3>
            I am a great admirer of Charlie Munger, who is best known as Warren Buffett's right hand man in Berkshire Hathaway. I am inspired 
            by his wisdom and philosophies, being able to think rationally and forever expanding his Mental Models to help in his decision-making. 
            Although, Charlie Munger was best known as an Investor, his philosophies and mental models can be applied across all walks of life.
